# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A recreation of the classic **Simon Says Game**, built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. This project challenged my logic-building skills and helped deepen my understanding of time-based interactions, arrays, and DOM events.

## 🚦 How It Works

- Press any key to start the game.
- Watch the pattern of lights (colors) and sounds.
- Repeat the exact sequence by clicking the buttons.
- Sequence grows with every level.
- Make a mistake? Game over. Try again!

## 🚀 Features

- Random color sequence generator
- Level-wise progression
- Game over detection with score tracking
- Dynamic styling and audio feedback
- Custom game over animation

## 💡 What I Learned

- DOM Manipulation & Event Handling
- setTimeout and delay sequencing
- Managing game state with arrays
- User feedback with visual + audio cues
- Building logic-heavy projects

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
